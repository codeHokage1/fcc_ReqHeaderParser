# Request Header Parser Microservice

This is a project done in completion of my Backend & API development course on FreeCodeCamp. It simply returns several the request header information.

Link to live API :link: : 

```
GET / 
// displays the homepage

GET /api/hello
// returns a json response to say hello

GET /api/whoami
// returns a json response with the request machine's IP Address, local language and Software details
```
